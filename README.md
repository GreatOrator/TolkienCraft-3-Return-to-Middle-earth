**All that once was....**

 

30 years have passed since the forming of the council, Man, Dwarf and Elf.  They came together to try to stop the coming darkness in Angmar.  At the same time, you were trying to stop Draconis from destruction and to contain the evil that was spreading to the Overworld.

Sadly, one by one, the free peoples were defeated as the growing evil was stronger than anyone realized.  The last time you were here, Strider, now known as Aragorn had said something about the ring you had returned to Bilbo and Gandalf had been researching.

It will be up to you to help fight back this evil and see what can be done to help the Fellowship succeed in a new task.  Be strong traveler and know that if ever a Hero was needed, the Hero of Draconis shall be the one to answer that call!

 

                                                                                               **...hope shall not fade.**
